# Titanic Survival Prediction 
# Author: Gopal Krishna 
# Batch: July A58
# Domain: DATA SCIENCE 

# **Aim**
In this project, we aimed to predict the survival of people onboard Titanic by employing Machine learning techniques in Python. The aim was to predict whether the passenger survived or not, based on features like class of a passenger age and sex.

# **Dataset:**
I began with a data set that was found on Kaggle, which provided information about passengers aboard the Titanic including their age and sex; class of ticket purchased as well as fare paid among other things. This was then split into training and testing data to help further model development.

# **Libraries Used:**
The project utilized several Python libraries including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks such as model training, evaluation, and prediction.

# **Data Processing:**
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different features and survival outcomes.

# **Model Training:**
Several machine learning algorithms were explored and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Cross-validation techniques were employed to assess model performance and avoid overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance.

# **Model Predictions:**
After training the models on the training dataset, they were used to make predictions on the test dataset. Model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different models in predicting survival outcomes.

# Conclusion 
This project not only aimed to develop a predictive model but also to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in solving real-world problems like survival prediction based on historical data.
